motorola m68k basic

motorola m68k basic interpreter for the 68k family microprocessors, constructed to be quick and powerful and easily ported between 68k systems. It requires few resources to run and includes instructions to facilitate easy low level handling of hardware devices. It also retains most of the powerful high level instructions from similar BASICs.

it is derived (my main purpose is to port this interpreter to GNU assembler/68k) from EhBASIC, which is Copyright by Lee Davison 2002 - 2012 and free for educational or personal use only.
